Breeze’s scaffolding is installed, you may navigate to our application’s /login or /register URLs in your web browser. All of Breeze's routes are defined within the routes/auth.php file, you should examine files inside resources/js/* files as well as controller inside app/Http/Controllers/* files, I am not explaining these files because already this topic going to huge, I want to stay in this topic only.

Now I will work backend and frontend at a time, for that we could code in several ways like traditional way means just create controller and methods which most of the developer is doing, or we could code like what can I say, it is mature that means when you are senior, your coding quality also talking that I am delivered by a senior, here I am showing you the way, may be in short, but believe me, very much effective if you want to learn, ok lets move to our topic, here I am having use repository pattern.

    In the context of software development, a repository is a design pattern that provides an abstraction layer for data access. The repository pattern is commonly used to separate the logic that retrieves data from the underlying storage (such as a database, API, or file system) from the rest of the application. This separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and flexible.

Lets create a “Contracts” directory inside our app folder, inside the “Contracts” folder create an interface “MemberRepositoryInterface.php” file.
